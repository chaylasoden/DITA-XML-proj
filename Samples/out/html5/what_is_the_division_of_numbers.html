        <p class="p">To successfully perform the task of dividing numbers, you should know what division is.
            "Division" is a mathematical concept in which you calculate the number of times a number
            is contained in another number.</p>
        <p class="p">So, the purpose of division is to divide a number into another number to find the
            quotient.</p>
        <p class="p">The obelus (รท) symbol represents division of numbers. </p>
        <p class="p">This same symbol is used in the app to represent division; therefore, it will complete
            the task of dividing numbers. </p>
