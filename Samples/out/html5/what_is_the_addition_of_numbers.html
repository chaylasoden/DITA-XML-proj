        <p class="p">To successfully perform the task of adding numbers, you should know what addition is.
            "Addition" is a mathematical concept in which you combine two numbers to find the sum,
            or total, between two numbers. </p>
        <p class="p">So, the purpose of addition is to create a larger number. We take one number and combine
            it with another.</p>
        <p class="p">The add (+) symbol represents addition of numbers. </p>
        <p class="p">This same symbol is used in the app to represent addition; therefore, it will complete
            the task of adding numbers. </p>
