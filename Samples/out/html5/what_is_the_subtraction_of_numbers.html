        <p class="p">To successfully perform the task of subtracting numbers, you should know what subtraction
            is. "Subtraction" is a mathematical concept in which you find the difference between two
            numbers. </p>
        <p class="p">So, the purpose of subtraction is to reduce a number into it's smaller form. We take one
            number away from the other.</p>
        <p class="p">The minus (-) symbol represents subtraction of numbers. </p>
        <p class="p">This same symbol is used in the app to represent subtraction; therefore, it will complete
            the task of subtracting numbers. </p>
